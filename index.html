                    My Name is Skyler Harrison Floyd. I was born in Dayton, Ohio on November 4th, 2004.
                    Shortly after I was born my parents moved to Delaware and I have lived here my whole life.
                    Before I went to DACC I went to Delaware Hayes High School.
                    I participated in theater and got officially inducted into the Thespian Troop 420. 
                    I worked as a spotlight and helped out with all the technical things.
                    I also participated in the bowling team.
                    I have been interested in coding since 7th grade and tried to take classes for it every year but they all were pseudocode.
                    I finally found out about DACC and the App Dev program and I had to jump on it.
